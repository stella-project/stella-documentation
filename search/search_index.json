By using STELLA, researchers can evaluate their experimental systems based on user feedback which stands in contrast to (or complements) the Cranfield-style approaches with test collections in offline evaluations. STELLA facilitates conventional AB tests but also more data-efficient interleaving experiments in which results lists of two ranking or recommender functions are mixed. A fundamental component of STELLA is the integration of experimental systems as micro-services. While previous living labs restricted the system results to the most popular top-k queries, we allow more comprehensive evaluations by integrating micro-services with entire retrieval and recommender systems. The Living Labs for Academic Search (LiLAS) lab at CLEF made use of the STELLA infrastructure and served as the first test-bed to evaluate the feasibility of our new infrastructure design. We welcome contributions and look for collaborations with researchers and sites alike.","title":"About"},{"location":"guides/single-machine/","text":"Setup guide (single server instance) 0. Overview This guide is intended for setting up an instance of the stella-app and the stella-server on a single machine. Both applications have to be in the same Docker network. Only then, the stella-app 's HTTP requests can reach the REST-API of the stella-server . These instructions will guide you through the following steps: Clone the repositories ( stella-server , stella-app ) Download the datasets (extracting and placing them in the correct directory) Configure the stella-server and the stella-app Build both Docker applications Sanity checks By the end, you should have both applications running and can simulate interactions with the stella-app, which in turn sends the feedback to the stella-server. By logging into the stella-server, you should be able to see plots in the dashboard and JSON-formatted downloads of the feedback data should be possible. Prerequisites: :warning: Make sure docker , docker-compose and the docker-sdk [1] are installed and executable! :warning: [1] The docker-sdk is actually only required for developing micro-services with experimental systems. Start with fresh copies of the repositories and make sure previous builds of the Docker images are removed. It may not be enough to stop the containers. In some cases, previous image builds (which are not up-to-date) might be re-used. 1. Clone the repositories Clone the repository of the stella-server: git clone https://github.com/stella-project/stella-server Clone the repository of the stella-app: git clone https://github.com/stella-project/stella-app 2. Download the datasets Download the datasets that are provided by LIVIVO and GESIS from the publicly shared Sciebo folder . More specifically, you should download the two folders gesis-search/ and livivo/ and place the uncompressed folders in the data/ directory of the stella-app. 3. Configure the stella-server and the stella-app Both applications have a config.py file. Leaving the configurations untouched after the repositories have been cloned is fine - there is actually no need to change anything here. Those who want to directly dive in, can skip the following lines and can continue with the Docker builds. For the curious minds, there are seperate pages for the stella-server 's config.py and the stella-app 's config.py . There you will find detailed descriptions of each configuration. For now, it is interesting to have a look at the following fields of stella-app 's config.py . Check if conf['app']['DEBUG'] = False . Check if conf['app']['BULK_INDEX'] = True . When starting the stella-app all experimental will start to index the data in parallel. There is no need to trigger any indexing process \"manually\". Check if conf[\"app\"][\"STELLA_SERVER_API\"] = \"http://nginx/stella/api/v1\" . This is the address of the stella-server in the Docker network. Only if both applications are in the same Docker network, they can communicate. Check the credentials that are used by the stella-app : conf[\"app\"][\"STELLA_SERVER_USER\"] = \"gesis@stella.org\" conf[\"app\"][\"STELLA_SERVER_PASS\"] = \"pass\" conf[\"app\"][\"STELLA_SERVER_USERNAME\"] = \"GESIS\" Per default, GESIS is set as the user of the stella-app , but you can change them to LIVIVO's with the help of the credentials given below. 4. Build both Docker applications The stella-server has to be built first! Its default network will be used as our Docker network. Build the stella-server with: cd stella-server/ docker-compose up -d Afterwards, the stella-app can be built. In the repository you will find two .yml -files. As part of this guide, you have to use the docker-compose.yml file . It will add the stella-app to the Docker network of the stella-server . You can ignore the local.yml - this one is intended for a setup independent of the stella-server . Build the stella-app with: cd stella-app/ docker-compose up -d This is the right moment to get a cup of coffee or any other beverage of your choice. It takes a while to build all the Docker images (all dependencies have to be retrieved from the web) and once the images are running in containers, the indexing will take some time. Please note that at the current stage, the stella-app has already too many experimental systems, so not all systems can start the indexing in parallel when starting the app on my laptop (16GB RAM, i7 4Cores@1.9GHz). Even though the stella-app forces all systems to build the index at once, some experimental systems will probably remain without an index, after the app has been started on lower-end devices. A current workaround for this problem is to trigger the indexing for specific experimental systems that do not have an index. This can either be done by the corresponding REST-endpoint ( /stella/api/v1/index/<string:container_name> ) or by visiting the dashboard of the stella-app and using the index button. 5. Sanity checks Once everything has been set up. We can check a few things first. 1st sanity check: visiting the dashboard If you did not change anything in the configurations, the stella-server should be visitable at http://0.0.0.0:80 . Log in with one of the provided credentials below. You should able to see a list with pre-registered system at http://0.0.0.0:80/systems and can visit an \"empty\" dashboard at http://0.0.0.0:80/dashboard . In the following, we will fill up the database of the stella-server with some feedback data. 2nd sanity check: Simulating feedback data and posting it via the REST endpoints of the stella-server In this step, we will simulate interactions and use the REST endpoints that are actually used by the stella-app later on. It can be seen as a pre-assessment, if the stella-server behaves as intended. Use the simulate.py script and make sure, the address of the stella-server is set correctly in the script. Once executed, you can revisit the dashboard and should be provided with some visualizations. Likewise, JSON-formatted feedback data should be exportable from the systems' overview. 3rd sanity check: Simulating feedback data and posting it via the REST endpoints of the stella-app In the previous step, we were using the REST endpoints that are intended to be used by the stella-app . In this step, we will also simulate data and send it to the stella-app , which in turn, will send it to the stella-server . Use the simulate.py script in the repository of the stella-app (make sure the address of the stella-app is correct). Revisit the stella-server and have a look at the dashboard.
